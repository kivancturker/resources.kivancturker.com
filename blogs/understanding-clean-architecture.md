# Understanding Clean Architecture in Modern Web Development

Clean Architecture has become increasingly important in modern web development as applications grow in complexity. In this post, we'll explore the core principles of Clean Architecture and how to implement them effectively in your web applications.

- Independent of frameworks
- Testable
- Independent of the UI
- Independent of the database
- Independent of any external agency
