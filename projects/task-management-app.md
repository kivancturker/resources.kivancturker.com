# Task Management Application

## Overview

A modern task management application designed to help teams collaborate efficiently. The application features real-time updates, drag-and-drop task organization, and a clean, intuitive interface.

## Technical Details

### Frontend Architecture

- **React** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Socket.IO Client** for real-time updates
- **React DnD** for drag-and-drop functionality
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design

### Backend Infrastructure

- **Node.js** with Express for API development
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose for data persistence
- **Socket.IO** for real-time communication
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Redis** for caching

### Key Features

1. Real-time collaboration
2. Drag-and-drop task organization
3. Task comments and attachments
4. User roles and permissions
5. Activity tracking
6. Email notifications
7. Mobile-responsive design

### Performance Optimizations

- Efficient state management with Redux
- WebSocket connection pooling
- MongoDB indexing for faster queries
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Lazy loading of components and images
